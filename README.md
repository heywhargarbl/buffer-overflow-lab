## Description

In this lab, we were asked to review the article [Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html) and to implement a buffer overflow attack on a legacy version of Linux. For this exercise we were provided [vuln.c](vuln.c), a vulnerable program that uses unsafe string manipulation. The goal was to write an exploit that would open up a reverse shell, the process of which I documented in my [writeup](writeup.md)
